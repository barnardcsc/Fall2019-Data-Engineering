# data-engineering-fall2019
An introductory data engineering workshop using SQL, Python, and an open NYC dataset on jobs. Developed and held by the CSC in Fall 2019.

The workshop covers web data queries and cleaning and working with data using Pandas. Follow along the workshop using the "2019-Fall-Data-Engineering-Prod-Student.ipynb" Jupyter notebook, which you can download and convert to Jupyter notebook by clicking on "raw" and copy-and-pasting the file into a raw text file. An example .xlsx file for practice with data normalizing is available in the main branch. The NYC jobs dataset is pulled from the NYC Open Data site.
